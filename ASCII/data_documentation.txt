Data in files are outputs of the landscape evolution model DAC (Divide And Capture). Three series of files are stored:

1) the coordinates of rivers, coordinatesxxx
2) the coordinates of divides, dividesxxx
3) the river node pairs across divides, no_channel_connectionxxx

The xxx in the file names stands for the time steps and it can be converted into model time.
