# landscape_physiographic_patchness
This repository stores MATLAB codes of a patch model that calculates and visualizes physiographic patches of a landscape evolution model and patch changes through time.  

## 1 Physiographic patch
The land surface (location and height) can be represented by a series of elemental surfaces ( _Si_ ). When defining a certain range of physiographic parameters, for example, elevation or hillslope gradient, elemental surfaces with parametric values falling in this range may be connected and form a contiguous patch of surface. Physiographic parameters used in this model are elevation, hillslope gradient, and hillslope aspect.



## 2 Patch model inputs
The patch model uses topographic data (location and height, _x_, _y_, _z_ ) of landscape evolution models (LEMs) to calculate patches that are defined by physiographic parameters.
